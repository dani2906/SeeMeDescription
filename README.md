# SeeMeDescription

seeme
In cities like New York stopping a cab could be both frustrating and dangerous. SeeMe is a simple app that was created to help people stop cabs by flashing their logo. Making drivers notice potential passengers from distance.

You can also use SeeMe to help your Uber or any other on demand cab service to notice you when you wait for them outside.
